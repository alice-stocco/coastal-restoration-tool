# Coastal Restoration Tool

This repository contains the files needed to run an interactive tool that supports the decision-making process when evaluating suitable ecological restoration techniques for coastal areas and wetlands along the river-to-sea continuum.  

The application is based on Shiny and is available at: https://ecological.shinyapps.io/coastal_restoration_tool/ .

## How to run the app on your computer
### Step 1: Download the script and the data
To run the app locally, contribute to the development of future versions, and update the database, you can download the folder /tool from this repository to get the files.
Alternatively, you can clone this repository with the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coastal_restoration_tool.git
```
After downloading or cloning, you will have a folder called tool that contains the following files:
    app.R: The main Shiny app script
    restoration_tool_dataset.xlsx: The database file

## Step 2: Open R and run the script
Make sure you have R installed (you can download it from [here](https://www.r-project.org/)).
Once the files are downloaded and the packages are installed, open the app.R file and run the script.
Read carefully the script and follow the instruction. Remember to replace the with your actual path to the folder /tool.
The app will launch in your default web browser.

## Database Updates

The database (restoration_tool_dataset.xlsx) is located in the /tool folder. To update the data, contact alice.stocco@unive.it .
